# Solar-System
2D responsive design of the solar system showcasing planets revolving around the Sun using HTML5, JS, and SCSS on VSCode.

Software and Operating System:
VSCode: Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop. It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Windows 10: The operating system where you're running VSCode.
Languages Used:
HTML5: Hypertext Markup Language (version 5) is the standard language used to structure and present content on the World Wide Web.
JavaScript (JS): A programming language that enables you to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
SCSS: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets is a preprocessor scripting language that is a superset of CSS.
Development Process:
Planning: Before starting coding, it's essential to plan out the structure and functionality of the solar system simulation. This involves deciding how the Sun and planets will be represented, how they will move, and how they will interact with each other.
HTML Structure: Create the basic structure of the HTML document. This will include elements for the Sun, planets, and any other components of the solar system.
Styling with SCSS: Use SCSS to style the elements defined in HTML. This includes defining colors, sizes, positions, and any animations or transitions.
JavaScript Logic: Write JavaScript code to implement the behavior of the solar system. This includes the logic for the planets to revolve around the Sun, the calculation of their positions, and any other interactive features.
Responsiveness: Ensure that the design is responsive, meaning it adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and devices. This may involve using CSS media queries to adjust layout and styling based on screen width.
Testing and Debugging: Test the solar system simulation in different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and functionality. Debug any issues that arise during testing.
Optimization: Optimize the code and assets to improve performance and loading times. This may involve minifying JavaScript and CSS files, optimizing images, and implementing other best practices.
Documentation: Document the code to make it easier for other developers (or yourself in the future) to understand and maintain.
Implementation:
Sun and Planets: Use HTML elements (e.g., <div> or <img>) to represent the Sun and planets. Position them using CSS and give them appropriate sizes and colors.
Animation: Use JavaScript to animate the planets revolving around the Sun. This can be achieved by updating the positions of the planets at regular intervals using functions like setInterval() or requestAnimationFrame().
Interactivity: Optionally, you can add interactivity to the simulation, such as allowing users to click and drag the planets or providing information about each planet when they hover over it.
Responsive Design: Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling of the solar system for different screen sizes. This ensures that the simulation looks good and functions properly on devices of all sizes, from smartphones to desktop computers.
Deployment:
Once the solar system simulation is complete, you can deploy it to a web server to make it accessible to others. This may involve uploading the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a hosting service or your own server.
